msgid "The Greatest Free Gift"
msgstr "最伟大的免费礼物"

msgid "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
msgstr "你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。"

msgid "Last but certainly not least, the best free gift is the gift of salvation from the Lord Jesus Christ."
msgstr "最后也是最重要的，最好的免费礼物就是主耶稣基督赐下的救恩。"

msgid "Who is Jesus?"
msgstr "耶稣是谁？"

msgid "Jesus is the Son of God, sent into the world to save us from our sins. He lived a perfect, sinless life, showed God's love through His teachings and miracles, and willingly gave His life on the cross as a sacrifice for us. Three days later, He rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death. Through Jesus, we can know God personally and receive the gift of eternal life."
msgstr "耶稣是神的儿子，被差遣到世上来拯救我们脱离罪恶。他过着完美无罪的生活，通过教导和神迹彰显了神的爱，并甘愿为我们牺牲在十字架上。三天后，他从死里复活，证明了他战胜了罪和死亡。借着耶稣，我们可以亲自认识神，并得着永生的礼物。"

msgid "What is Salvation?"
msgstr "什么是救恩？"

msgid "Salvation means being rescued from the consequences of sin—our separation from God and spiritual death. The Bible teaches that everyone has sinned and falls short of God's perfect standard. Sin breaks our relationship with God and leads to eternal separation from Him."
msgstr "救恩意味着从罪的后果中被拯救——即与神隔绝和属灵的死亡。圣经教导我们，世人都犯了罪，达不到神完美的标准。罪使我们与神的关系破裂，并导致与神永远分离。"

msgid "Why Do We Need Salvation?"
msgstr "我们为什么需要救恩？"

msgid "We need salvation because sin separates us from God. On our own, we cannot restore this relationship. But God, in His love, sent Jesus Christ to die for our sins and rise again, so that anyone who believes in Him can be forgiven and reconciled to God."
msgstr "我们需要救恩，因为罪使我们与神隔绝。靠我们自己无法修复这种关系。但神因着爱，差遣耶稣基督为我们的罪而死，并从死里复活，使一切信他的人都能被赦免，与神和好。"

msgid "Salvation is a free gift, received by faith in Jesus Christ—not by our own efforts or good deeds. Through Him, we receive new life and the promise of eternity with God."
msgstr "救恩是免费的礼物，凭着对耶稣基督的信心而得，不是靠我们自己的努力或善行。借着他，我们得着新生命，并有与神同在永恒的应许。"
